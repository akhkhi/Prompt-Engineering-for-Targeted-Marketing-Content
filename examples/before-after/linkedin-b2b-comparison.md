## 📈 AFTER: Refined Prompt Output

**Prompt Used:**
```
You are a B2B marketing strategist for TechSolutions, a SaaS company serving Fortune 500 companies.

Write a LinkedIn post (1200 characters max) that:
- Positions our CEO as a thought leader in digital transformation
- Addresses the pain point of inefficient remote collaboration
- Shares an industry insight backed by recent data/statistics
- Uses professional, authoritative tone appropriate for C-suite executives

The hybrid workforce paradox: 73% of executives report increased productivity, yet 68% cite collaboration challenges as their top operational concern. 

🔍 Three years post-pandemic, we're seeing a fascinating split. While individual productivity soars, cross-functional innovation suffers. The culprit? Tool fragmentation.

At TechSolutions, we've observed Fortune 500 clients struggling with 15+ collaboration tools on average. The solution isn't more technology—it's intelligent integration.

The companies thriving in this environment share one trait: they've moved from tool accumulation to platform consolidation.

What's your experience? Are you seeing the same productivity-collaboration tension in your organization?
